## demoConstruct

**SLAM, Gaussian Splatting \| Python, Babylon.js, WebXR**

### Overview

demoConstruct is an open-source project that blends SLAM, digital twins, and collaborative 3D scene editing. This project goes beyond traditional 3D reconstruction to create an accessible and practical system for real-world applications in disaster response, medical rehabilitation, and collaborative design.

### Key Features

- **Progressive 3D Reconstruction**: Create accurate virtual representations of physical spaces with near real-time reconstruction for immediate feedback
- **Collaborative Editing**: Multi-user environment for simultaneous editing and interaction with the 3D reconstructed scene.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Web-based interface, accessible through standard web browsers, works seamlessly across different devices (desktop, Tablet, VR)

### Technologies Used

- **Front-end**: Babylon.js, WebXR, Swift
- **Back-end**: Python, SLAM, Gaussian Splatting

### Applications

- **Medical Rehabilitation**: Virtual environments for physical therapy and rehabilitation
- **Disaster Response**: Rapid 3D mapping of disaster zones for emergency planning

### Research Impact

demoConstruct advances spatial computing by combining SLAM, collaborative 3D editing, and accessible web-based tools. Its open-source nature enables researchers and developers to adapt the system across diverse domains, from healthcare to disaster response.

Currently, the platform is being piloted with [Tan Tock Seng Hospital](https://www.ttsh.com.sg/Pages/default.aspx) (TTSH), Singapore, to support virtual rehabilitation in clinical settings, demonstrating its potential for real-world applications.

## demoConstruct

**SLAM, Gaussian Splatting \| Python, Babylon.js, WebXR**

### Overview

demoConstruct is an open-source project that blends SLAM, digital twins, and collaborative 3D scene editing. It goes beyond traditional 3D reconstruction to create an accessible and practical system for real-world applications in disaster response, medical rehabilitation, and collaborative design.

### Research Impact

demoConstruct advances spatial computing by combining SLAM, collaborative 3D editing, and accessible web-based tools. Its open-source framework enables researchers and developers to adapt the system across diverse domains, from healthcare to emergency response.

Currently, the platform is being piloted with [Tan Tock Seng Hospital](https://www.ttsh.com.sg/Pages/default.aspx) (TTSH), Singapore, to support virtual rehabilitation in clinical settings, demonstrating its potential for real-world applications.
